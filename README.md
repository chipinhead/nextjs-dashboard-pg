## Next.js App Router Course - Starter (Modified)

This is a modified version of the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application with some important changes:

### Key Modification:
- The original tutorial uses Vercel's postgres package, which does not work locally.
- This version replaces it with the standard `pg` Node.js library for PostgreSQL connectivity.

This change allows for local development and testing without relying on Vercel-specific packages.

For more information on the original course, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
